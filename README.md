# 🧠 Alteryx Workflow Showcase

A comprehensive collection of **Alteryx Designer workflows** built to demonstrate data automation, analytics, and machine learning capabilities.  
This repository serves as a **visual gallery** of projects where Alteryx was used to simplify, optimize, and automate complex analytical tasks — from financial reconciliations to predictive modeling.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is designed to:
- Showcase **real-world data workflows** created using Alteryx Designer.  
- Demonstrate **no-code/low-code automation** in data analytics, machine learning, and reporting.  
- Serve as a **portfolio reference** for recruiters, peers, and professionals exploring Alteryx use cases.  
- Provide a **learning resource** for those looking to understand workflow design patterns and logic structures.

## 💼 Featured Projects

### 🩺 Doctor Fee Prediction (Alteryx + Machine Learning)
Predicting doctor consultation fees using **Alteryx Assisted Modeling** and regression algorithms.
- Built an **end-to-end ML pipeline** using Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree models.  
- Automated feature encoding, model fitting, and multi-model prediction comparison.  
- Combined **Python-based EDA** and **no-code model training** for hybrid analytics.
